# edutainment

Your goal is to build an “edutainment” app for kids to help them practice multiplication tables – “what is 7 x 8?” and so on. Edutainment apps are educational at their code, but ideally have enough playfulness about them to make kids want to play.

Breaking it down:

The player needs to select which multiplication tables they want to practice. This could be pressing buttons, or it could be an “Up to…” stepper, going from 2 to 12.
The player should be able to select how many questions they want to be asked: 5, 10, or 20.
You should randomly generate as many questions as they asked for, within the difficulty range they asked for.

At the very least, you should:

Start with an App template, then add some state to determine whether the game is active or whether you’re asking for settings.
Generate a range of questions based on the user’s settings.
Show the player how many questions they got correct at the end of the game, then offer to let them play again.
